            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Much indeed might be ſaid concerning theſe things, yet becauſe we have ſpoken thereof in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, we will therefore (for brevity ſake) omit them, only declaring that in this Age, there was a great Conjunction of ♃ and ♄ in the firſt face of Sagittary, now finiſhed and perfected in the Watery Triplicity: concerning which, mention was made in our books of great Conjunctions; notwithſtanding we will here add ſomething more, for further explanation.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that the great Conjunctions of the weightier Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are wont to produce great effects, as the changes of Monarchies and Kingdomes, the comming of Prophets and the like; by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the dead ſhall be changed, and all things ſhall be renewed, and now ſhall thoſe Sciences be revealed, which in ancient time Kings and Princes found out: and regard ſhall be had to the Doctrine and Congregations of Learned men. But in our Age new Sciences are not only found out, but in ſome meaſure, men ſeem to oppoſe the inventions themſelves.</p>
            <p>Indeed from theſe great Conjunctions, and happy ſignifications of the Planets, (with reſpect had to the Lord of the Ninth houſe,) ſhall flow Doctrines and Sciences; and wiſe men ſhall be elected, who ſhall invent new learning: for like as the cauſes are, ſo ſhall the effects be; for good Conjunctions are wont to beſtow goodneſs, and good Magisſtrate; but evill the contrary, criminall cuſtoms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: hence alſo ſhall wicked rulers be produced for the ſin of the people; deceipts, wars, and Tyrants ſhall ariſe, and ſhall oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to peace, tranquillity, and lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For theſe cauſes (in ancient time) Learned and wiſe men were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be Kings and Princes, and ſuch as were skilfull in all Arts and Sciences, and amongſt the Perſians, none was elected King, who was not verſed in <hi>Magick</hi> and the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> (whence thoſe Kings were called <hi>Magi,</hi> and wiſe men) that they might govern the people rightly. But now adaies as well the unlearned, as learned, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (by inheritance) to the government of Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in <hi>Aegypt, Chaldea, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> where the inventors of Sciences, and all learning flouriſhed; thoſe that addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtudy thereof ſhall now be ſeverely puniſhed, and thoſe Regions at this preſent are in a manner quite diſpoiled of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: And it is evident that theſe things happened after the great Conjunction in the Fourth houſe, and falſe ſign <hi>Scorpio,</hi> having great force over thoſe Countreys.</p>
            <p>Which Scorpioniſticall Conjunction, and decay of the learning of the Aegyptians being foreſeen by the moſt wiſe <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> to his unſpeakable grief; he was conſtrained with a ſorrowfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing ſoul thus to exclaime:</p>
            <q>
               <p>O Ægypt! There remains only the Stories of thy wiſdom and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For behold, the divinity of Sciences is returned into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and only perverſe, and ignorant men ſhall abide on earth. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he that would apply himſelf to the true ſtudy of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be puniſhed with death:</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> with how much truth no man is ignorant.</p>
            <p>The Roman Empire alſo, which had been accuſtomed to elect its King amongſt the valiant Captains of War, ſtoops now to Clerks, that be ſtrangers to War: wherefore the great Conjunctions do not only foreſhew that; but Kingdoms alſo and Cities are governed by the great years of the Planets, which are deſcribed by Wiſe men; ſome whereof be 1460. others 520. others 480. others 465. others 428. others 264. and the reſt, 260. and the Cities and Kingdoms are in the height of their Government according to theſe years: and firſt they begin to decline their Government, and then fall into ſervitude and deſtruction: ſo that it is no wonder, if Cities, and Kingdoms, and Monarchies do change their manner of Government, and as it were a thing deſerted of its preſiding Planet, flyeth to another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Planets: and ſo alwaies Kingdomes and Cities, when they have finiſhed their years, they proceed to worſe, and alwaies decline, and the ſtarrs do ruinate and deſtroy their government and cuſtome, and by that means the conditions of men become contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114141:8"/>
whereby Seditions, and hatred, vices, and evill behaviour are raiſed in Cities; and when thoſe things do reign in Cities, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Planets are deſtructions of government, and ſo by thoſe vices flowing from the Planets, Cities and Kingdoms are deſtroyed, and led into Captivity, or transferred to a ſtrange Government.</p>
            <p>We finde alſo that ſo oft as the Creator of all things hath any new Law to eſtabliſh in the world, or any other good, for the benefit of man, or any evil as a ſcourge for ſin; it is his pleaſure to admoniſh all the faithfull that ſuch things are to ſucceed, yea long before they happen, and this in ſuch manner as that they ſhould truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be God, and adore him. The truth of which is affirmed by ſo many holy books of the Old Law, wherein the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told all things which were to befall the Hebrews; yea, it was ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more deſigned in the Univerſall Book of Heaven, and demonſtrated by the great Conjunctions, As that Conjunction under the Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> did the Circumciſion: The Conjunction in ♓ under the image of <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> did the Moſaicall Law; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in ♌ under the <hi>image of Vexillus</hi> the firſt Emperour: The Sect of the Chaldeans in the Conjunction of ♄ ♃ and ♂: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chaldeans did begin their burnt Sacrifices, and worſhiped the Divinity beleeved by them to be mixt with the fire, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the fire was changed into God, it's former accidents ſtill remaining.</p>
            <p>So the Sect of the Ægyptians by the Congreſs of ♄, ♃, and the ☉, wherefore they worſhiped the Conſtellations of Heaven, and the Hoſt of the Sun.</p>
            <p>But the Sect of the Sarazens was premonſtrated by the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ♄, ♃, and ♀ who grew in luxury and concupiſcence.</p>
            <p>So God before the coming of our Saviour ſhewed a ſign in heaven by the great ☌ of ♄ ♃ and ☿ in the firſt decade of <hi>Virgo</hi> with change of Triplicity; concerning which ſign of <hi>Virgo, Albumazar</hi> in the 6. of his <hi>Introduct.

            <p>The Sect alſo of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was premonſtrated by the Stars; and we noted <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. of great Conjunctions, That the ☌ of ♄ and ♃ in ♏ with the ☌ of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and the warlike irradiation of ♂ in the year of the world 4271. ſignified the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the Turks, and ſeeing that ♏ wherein that ☌ happened (by the 2. <hi>Quadr. com.</hi> 54.) is the houſe of ☌, with the ☌ of him, and the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, for this cauſe, untill this preſent time he retaineth warlike and Lunar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that Law of his enjoyns all kinde of rude, groſs, and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things, Pleaſures, Vices, Wickedneſs, Luxuries, and Rapes, Wars, Conflicts, and Effuſion of Blood: and for that the new place of the ☌ is Cancer of which the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is Lady, therefore we conclude the Law of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> to be Lunar and Martiall (by the Authority of <hi>Albumazar, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Differ.</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>Mag.

Therefore that Law is rude, and groſs, popular, and an enemy to learning, even as the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are, for (by reaſon of the dominion of <hi>Mars</hi>) it enjoyneth it ſelf to be protected, not with Arguments, but Arms: hence it is, that whoſoever ſhall but in the leaſt degree ſcandalize their Law, ſhall be ſlain with Iron: And becauſe the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is exceeding ſwift in compariſon of the other Planets, therefore ſhall it vehemently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-value all other Laws; Nor will it be ſaid to be preſidented by another.</p>
            <p>In like manner the bringing in of Religion, Letters, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline were ſignified in heaven, and men that were excellent in Arts, as we may read 3. <hi>Quadr.</hi> So likewiſe the coming of ſuch men, as ſhould oppoſe (and wreſt things from) the truth, as <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the like, which for brevity ſake we omit, affirming only (and daily experience ſheweth it) That God the Creator of all things, hath written all things in his Univerſall book of Heaven, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they be hidden from many.</p>
            <p>In the interim, we will declare whatſoever we can (darkly) read
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114141:9"/>
in that great book of Heaven: We ſay [Darkly] becauſe we ought to aſſure Contingencies, indeterminate, and by no means with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, for by the 1. <hi>Segm. Aph.</hi> 3. <hi>Artes, que proprus ſubjectis inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, nihil certi polliceri de futuris poſſunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Aſtrologer ought never to pronounce any thing abſolutely, concerning future events, and it is worſe for him to beleeve that he knoweth thoſe things, which he does not know, then to be ignorant of ſuch things as he ſhould know (by 1 <hi>Segm. Aph.</hi> 78.)</p>
            <p>Therefore we will ſay concerning the corroboration of things, as we have done in our books of great Conjunctions, and as we have before noted: but before we come to the great Conjunction of the year. 1603. and to the Mock-ſtar, which appeared in the fiery Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. which laſted alſo for one whole year, we will firſt handle the Comet, that appeared <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. and the great ☌ that happened <hi>Anno</hi> 1583. in the third Decade of ♓, when there was a change of the ☌ from one Triplicity into another, <hi>viz.</hi> from the watery into the fiery: Which Comet and great ☌ have not hitherto manifeſted their effects, by reaſon of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, magnitude and ſlow motion: For the elements and mixt things are not preſently to aſſume the magnitude of Form, but are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a certain ſpace of time, and with the time alſo the form is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced: ſo that both by reaſon of great Conjunctions, Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtars, Comets, Eclipſes, and other by-paſt caliſes being almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the form begins to be introduced, and the effects begin to manifeſt and lay open themſelves, and now we ſhall begin to taſt the firſt offerings of great Revolutions.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed any further, we conceive this one thing worthy our notice: that like as the faithfull in Chriſt (laying aſide the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle, Ptolomy,</hi> and others, as well Philoſophers, as Aſtrologers) all thoſe cauſes, (which the Philoſophers and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers call no cauſes, but ſigns of the mighty and ſupream cauſe) we will enjoyn our ſelves to aſcribe for ſigns, and will atteſt the ſame as formerly we have declared: Therefore we ſay, that as well the great Conjunctions, as Mock-ſtars, Comets, Eclipſes, and the like, ought not to be called the cauſes of future events, but ſigns ſent from the Supream Cauſe, and from our Saviour Chriſt, for the abomination of the world (and the ſame is ſtrongly maintained, in the ſayings of Aſtrologers: eſpeciall by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in his <hi>Centiloquy,</hi> and <hi>Apoth.</hi> but chiefly in his <hi>Apoth.</hi> and <hi>Aph.</hi> 3.) Becauſe that Arts, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their proper ſubjects, can affirm nothing for certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114141:10"/>
future events: Therefore, an Aſtrologer ought not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any thing abſolutely concerning future accidents.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the hidden ſecrets of God are impenitrable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we intend (not as ſpeculators, and ſcrewers out of the ſecrets of God) to prognoſticate any thing, but (with the Philoſophers and Aſtrologers) it is lawfull and requiſite, that we conjecture ſomewhat about the ſigns according to the effects of the Stars, and like one that is parblinde ſeeing a thing a far off, diſcernes only a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſhadow, reſembling many things, without knowing certainly what it is by 2 <hi>Apot. Com.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>The caſe ſtanding thus, we will come in the firſt place to the Mock-ſtars, which appeared <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. and 1604. which remained immoveable: The firſt in the Chair of <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> not far from that ſtar in the erection of its ſeat in the Milky way, whoſe Longitude, was <hi>degr.</hi> 16. 54. of ♉: Its Latitude North <hi>degr.</hi> 53. min 45. Its Magnitude exceeded not onely the ſtars of the firſt light, but alſo ♃ and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the beginning of its appearance: therefore, we may conclude that this Mock-ſtar, did exceed the bigneſs of the earth more then 500. times, and that this is truth, it is the teſtimony of <hi>Tycho:</hi> for although the ſtars do ſeem but very little to us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not unlike little faces in heaven, yet by the ingenious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mathematitians it is found out that they are not only equall to the whole Terreſtriall Globe, but far exceed it by their greatneſs, ſo that ſcarce any ſo little a Star can be ſeen in the Firmament, but it exceeds (at the leaſt) 18. times the bigneſs of the earth; as (not to ſpeak of others) thoſe Stars that be of the firſt magnitude, exceed the earth 500. times in bigneſs: And though this may ſeem incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to many, yet will it not admit of any doubt in any man that rightly conſiders their unſpeakable diſtance from us. Therefore if theſe little Stars appeared but ſmall to our ſight, yet certainly they were of a huge magnitude.</p>
            <p>VVherefore from the beginning, when it farr exceeded the Stars of the firſt Magnitude, he exceeded the Earth by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible quantity: For, if the fixed Stars of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as 'tis ſaid, exceed the earth according to Mathematitians, 500. times, even ſo this new Star, ſo much as he was removed from the Earth had a far greater viſible Diameter. It will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſarily follow that from the beginning it exceeded that quantity which the earth and water make, much more then 100. times but in progreſs of time it diminiſhed by little and little, that at laſt it vaniſhed to nothing.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:114141:10"/>
            <p>Whereby it appears that the opinion of us and others, hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been erroneous, whilſt we thought Vapours to be tranſmitted into heaven, and generated Comets, and new Starrs: For if this Starr exceeded the earth more then 500. times, from whence ſhould ſo many Vapours ariſe? Therefore we ſay, that the matter whereof new Starrs are made, is a tranſparent ſubſtance of heaven, and a Diaphanous or perſpicuous corpulency of the heavens; and that it may be reduced to form: we ſay, that a new Starr, is the Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thin parts of heaven; which indeed is a tranſmutation of the Diaphanous parts of the Sky into lightneſs, of which, here is no place to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>As touching the light of the Mock-Starr, <hi>Tycho</hi> ſaid, it was more fulgent and radiant then the reſt: inſomuch, that in the beginning, it was ſometimes beheld in the day time, about noon; the heaven not being obfuſcated with the thickneſs of the Aire. It twinckled alſo as the other ſixed Starrs, and for the moſt part (but not alwaies) it retained the ſame colour, which was obſerved from the beginning, to wax white, and inflamed with a Joviall ſplendour, but in proceſs of time the light being preſſed together, and thickened: it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into a fiery red, and <hi>Mars</hi>-like brightneſs, like to <hi>Aldeboran,</hi> or that which ſhineth ruddily, in the right ſhoulder of <hi>Orion:</hi> yet it was not ſo fiery-red as this on the ſhoulder, but came neerer the colour of <hi>Aldeboran;</hi> yet afterwards having loſt its <hi>Mars</hi>-like colour, it changed into a pale whiteneſs; ſo that in the end, it became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Saturnine and Venereall.</p>
            <p>Another Mock-Starr <hi>Anno.</hi> 1604. about the beginning of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> untill the moneth of <hi>February</hi> 1606. was likewiſe ſeen from the moſt remote and ſundry Climates of the Earth, in the South part of the heavens, in the ſigne of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>viz. Degr.</hi> 17. of the ſame, with North Latitude, concerning which, <hi>Kepler</hi> ſaid that the Starr was leſs then Venus according to its viſible quantity; exactly round, caſting no hair, nor beard conſtantly to any part, like to the fixed Starrs, ſhooting with beams on every ſide, like the beams of the fixed Starrs, with a moſt clear twinckling, with ſuch Gliſtering, or brandiſhing ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that ſome ſaid they never obſerved any thing in the heavens, in all their time, to have ſo ſwift a Motion.</p>
            <p>The colours changed at every moment, like to a many-angled Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, by which turning the Sun beams upon the eyes of the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, will reflect with a variable brightneſs; for from a bright Yellow, anon it became Croc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all, in a moment like unto Purple and Reddiſh:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114141:11"/>
For the moſt part it was ſeen White: after it was elevated a little higher from the Vapours, it was bigger then the Starrs of the firſt magnitude, ♄ ♃ and ♂ eaſy to be diſtinguiſhed by an amiable and fair ſtillneſs of light, from the turbulent Corruſcation of a Starr.</p>
            <p>All Aſtronomers placed it amongſt the fixed Stars, becauſe it ſtill kept the ſame diſtance from them: From ♃ and ♂ is was ſo much diſtant every day, as was their diurnall motion under the fixed Stars, ſo that this Starr moved not from them, but they from it; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever point it toucht in the riſing; it ſtill moved in the ſame parallel: wherefore it was not only above the Moon but even in the high Orb of the fixed Starrs, becauſe it had no ſenſible Parrallax, and for that alſo it wanted a proper Motion diſtinct from that of the fixed Starrs. It remained not all the time of its continuance in the ſame place, and nigh to the ſame Schematiſmicall Starrs, with the Starrs in the foot of the Shank; and in the right Knee of the Serpent, and with the Triangle in the ſting of the Serpent; and occauſe alſo it had a moſt pure light and ſuddain twinkling, which the Planets have not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in <hi>Poſt.</hi> For that there he affirmeth, that higher Stars have a purer light, and greater twinckling.</p>
            <p>Therefore we conclude with <hi>Tycho,</hi> that thoſe New Starrs were ſuch: as never appeared before from the beginning of the world, and that they continued in the ſame places of the heaven above a whole year, and were at length ſucceſſively diſperſed: And therefore are to be accounted miracles in the expectation of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but more in their underſtanding; and amongſt thoſe things which have been ſeen ſince the beginning of the world, in the whole nature of things, and which be recorded in Hiſtory, are ſpectacles to be wondred at, if not the greateſt at leaſt, in reſpect of thoſe which were prepared; ſuch as was the inhibition of the Suns courſe in the time of <hi>Joſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Or then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sun, which happened the day and houres when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt the Son of God offered himſelf upon the Altar of the Croſs, a ſacrifice to his eternall Father for the Redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: The Sun then hiding his face, and ſorrowing for the light and beams upon earth; as by which all things, as well the Sun himſelf, as all other bodies of the whole world, both Coeleſtiall and Terreſtriall were made, diſdaining to ſee him made man for mankind, and to undergo an ignominious death; a thing ſo unworthy, and hiding his face for pity and ſhame. That this Eclipſe of the Sun happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114141:11"/>
the full Moon, when the Paſſeover of the Jews was celebrated, is not to be doubted: And that then the Sun could not be naturally E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed in regard the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, then was near diametrically oppoſed to him, and ſo could not be removed to betwixt the Sun and our ſight, what is he ſo meanly inſtructed in the knowledge of heavenly things, that is ignorant hereof? Wherefore <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> being then at <hi>Athens,</hi> and beholding this miraculous Eclipſe of the Sun, Cryed out, <hi>Aut mundi Authorem pati, vel Machinam ejus diſſolutum iri,</hi> That either the God of nature ſuffereth, or the Fabrick of the whole world ſhall be diſſolved: as himſelf witneſſeth, writing to <hi>Policarpus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſuch Prodigious wonders (I ſay) and miraculous works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the accuſtomed order of Nature, which the holy Scriptures do teſtifie to have happened of old: we hold it requiſite, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to the world theſe new Stars which appeared in our Age; for that they were truly and indeed ſuch; we will ſo certainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that none ſhall have ground to queſtion it.</p>
            <p>For that ſome Stars like unto the reſt, yea, ſometime more reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and which twinkle more, do newly, and ſuddenly appear unto us, and remain long unmoveable in the higheſt Region of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall world, is no leſs miracle then that the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill, go backward, or ſuffer any Eclipſe without the preſence of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>: becauſe that any thing which was not before ſhould appear in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (<hi>ex improviſo</hi>) like as the reſt of its moiſt vapours; is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſtrange, as for thoſe things which were lights from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be affected againſt cuſtom and conſtant Order.</p>
            <p>But what may the great Portents of theſe Mock-ſtars ſignifie, (like as alſo <hi>Tycho</hi> ſaid,) ſeeing that it is unuſual, and that we can have but little or no knowledge therein, for (by the 3. <hi>Aph.</hi> 129.) <hi>Sine exemplo artem condere temerarium, cum uno vel duobus leve, cum plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus autem negotioſum, ſolum aliquam conjecturam univerſalem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctam, &amp; indeterminatam, &amp; qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For firſt of all we ſay (ſo God illuſtrating our Intellect) that before the change of the great ☌ was compleated from one Triplicity into another, <hi>viz,</hi> from the watery into the fiery, from which the mutations of the world were wont to proceed eſpecially, for ♃ and ♄ do change and convert things, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

of the change, ſhall be when they are changed from one Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity into another in Conjunctions, and from one figure into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (according to <hi>Almanzar Aph.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>.) Wherefore ſeeing that in the watery Triplicity (as hath been ſaid) the Congregation of the Turks, and that now every Law ſhall be diſſolved by its contrary, (by <hi>lib. de Supplem. Almanach cap.</hi> 22 and 20 <hi>Apot. Com.</hi> 17.) Upon good grounds therefore do they confirme the obſervations of the heavens; eſpecially becauſe the Conjunctions in the fiery Triplicity, as being contrary to the watery, ſhall diſſolve the Laws that were made in the fiery Triplicity, (as we have ſaid in our books <hi>de Max. Con.</hi> Where alſo we have declared, both the extirpation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the end of the Turkiſh Law. I ſay, that before the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Circumgyration of great Conjunctions in the watery Triplicity, the firſt Mock-Starr appeared; which (beſides what may be ſaid hereafter) doth ſignifie ſome falſe Prophet that ſhall appear in the world; whoſe geſture, manners, and power, we ſhall by and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, ſo often as we ſhall conſider his ſcite, immobility, colour, and light, and the Applications of the Planets, which being had, we ſhall look to ſatisfie in ſome meaſure that 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 13. becauſe that the principles of the Art, are three; Reaſon, Sence, and experience, but the principles of the operations be four; the Planets, the parts of Heaven, the fixed Stars, and the Scituation.</p>
            <p>But before we will give a reaſon for what we do (for to ſuch things as are not according to reaſon, we muſt not give truſt) nor as they may be of long continuance are they to be hoped for, therefore (by the 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 5.) we ſay with <hi>Abraham, lib.

            <p>Nevertheleſs, ſeeing that we cannot have the preciſe Horoſcope of the great Conjunction, (becauſe of the ſlowneſs of their Motion) nor of the Revolution, for the reaſons alleaged 2. <hi>de Max.

Or if we will conſider the Signe aſcending at the time of the Revolution

of the year 1583.

            <p>Moreover, if we rightly conſider, that this Mock-Starr was found not only in that great Conjunction of the year 1583. in the third Houſe; but that alſo in other former great Conjunctions it fell in ſuch Houſes, as have ſignification of a falſe Prophet, and change of Laws: and that this is truth (before we come to the handling there-, of) the foundation is laid <hi>Seg.</hi> 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 206. <hi>Cometes mutantes Leges ſi in</hi> 9 <hi>

            <p>And that the Mock-ſtarr was neer unto the Aequinoctiall colour, none ever doubted, ſeeing that alſo its right Aſcention 0 <hi>Degr.</hi> 26. <hi>min.</hi> of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the Mid-heaven <hi>Degr.</hi> 0. 29. <hi>min.</hi> of the ſame ſigne in the place of the Conjunction, was of the eighth and ninth Orb, which is in the Interſection of the Ecliptique and Aequinoctiall circles: Which alſo, in regard that the head of <hi>Aries</hi> of the little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the eighth Sphere, is in the ſame Longitude with the head of <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the Center of the little circle of the ninth Sphere, at the time of our Saviours coming, doth alſo confirm ſuch a ſigne, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying religion, as we are rightly taught of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> 2. <hi>Apot. Text</hi> 37. Who affirmeth, that the Aequinoctials have ſignification of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and the Tropicks of divine worſhip, the Mutation of the Air, and of Laws and cuſtoms in publique affaires. And Haly in his Comment, declareth the cauſe thereof, ſaying, that in ſuch Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall ſignes, is made an increaſe of the daies and nights, like as when the Sun is in <hi>Aries</hi> he increaſeth the day: and whilſt he is in <hi>Libra,</hi> the night. Therefore he ſaith, that foraſmuch as an agreement of men may be ſignified by the Aequinoctiall ſignes; even ſo alſo here: But Laws do more evidently conſiſt by the change of opinions, which is ſignified by the Aequinoctiall ſignes, becauſe while the Sun is in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114141:13"/>
Aequinoctiall ſignes he ſometimes makes 24. minutes of declination in one day; wherefore he produceth the leſs change in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: But there is no greater alteration then the Promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, which for the moſt part is made againſt the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes, and the pain of death, and the accord of Senators and Magiſtrates; ſo that its like to a burning Torch in the mindes of men which is carried with a mighty force, like to one gaſping with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed breath for the fear of death, and favour of Princes, and for the civill Laws (in their peculiar benefits:) ſo that ſome, contrary to all humanity, and for the love they bear to the Law, (now they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves conſtantly) rejoyce to have them tormented by the Executioners.</p>
            <p>And there is another reaſon of the ſimilitude, becauſe the beginning of the Aequinoctiall ſigne is Common to both Hemiſpheres: So alſo thoſe Laws are Common amongſt all humane kinde. Therefore are the Laws rightly aſſimulated and attributed to the Aequinoctiall ſignes.</p>
            <p>But the Tropicall ſignes are the chief promoters of the change of Laws; becauſe the Tropicks are furtheſt diſtant from the Aequinoxes, and for that when the Sun is in them, he changes his courſe: for if he firſt go towards the ſouth, when he enters <hi>Capricorn,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reaſon he returns Northward when he enters <hi>Cancer.</hi> For the chang of cuſtoms is performed by the ſame reaſon that the change of Laws is: becauſe the change of Laws and cuſtoms are equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Therefore this Mock-ſtarr being in the Aequinoctiall colour and point, ſigniſieth ſome great man that ſhall alter Laws.</p>
            <p>Seeing likewiſe, that is was of the complexion of ♃ or ♀ and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what exceeded the clearneſs of the Comet called <hi>Milex,</hi> at whoſe appearance, ſuch men as changed Laws, and offended Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates appeared: (for Comets that be very clear and conſpicuous and alſo moveable, and of long continuance, preſignify a change of Empires by the 5 <hi>Aph.</hi> 15.) much more may this Mock-ſtarr ſignifie the ſame thing, in regard that it was bigger to our thinking, of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continuance, and more fixed then any other Comet; and the end thereof Tragicall, violent, and with much effuſion of blood, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments and exiles, becauſe the ſame Mock ſtarr was compoſed of a Ruddy, and afterwards of a Pale white.</p>
            <p>Becauſe in the exaltation of the Moon, which helps much in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of falſe Prophets, like as <hi>Albumazar</hi> teacheth <hi>Tract.</hi> 1. <hi>Differ.</hi> 3.

a ſquare aſpect, beholding the Conjunction applyed to the ſouth Node, running through the 3 and 4 Manſion of heaven, ſignifying the worſt conditions of a falſe Prophet. But of theſe afterwards.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the laſt Lunar Religion, even as alſo (as we have it from <hi>Ovid</hi> in his Pook <hi>de Vetula</hi>) the years number from the beginning of the world, until the conſummation thereof, is divided into 6 parts or ages, the government of every one of theſe ages, is attributed to one of 6 Planets, for ♃ is excluded, as being the peculiar ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Faith, by the doctrine of <hi>Albumazar Tract.</hi> 1. <hi>differ.</hi> 4. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Age of the world was attributed to <hi>Saturn,</hi> becauſe that ♃ (the ſignificator of faith) was firſt imbraced by him, in the 24 <hi>degr.</hi> of ♒<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at that time the Jews prevailed; for as <hi>Saturn,</hi> who apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the ☌ of the other Planets, but all of them to the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him; ſo that Law would acknowledge no other; but all that ſucceeded beleeved it: and becauſe ♄ is of a dry nature; and for that the great ☌ was in ♒ a fixed ſigne, therefore muſt that Law needs be conſtant and permanent, becauſe that when any impreſſion is made in that which is dry, it is of a difficult extraction: This the Complexion of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> eſpecially ſheweth. And for that ♄ is of profound counſell (as hath been ſaid) therefore they uphold their Laws by their ſtedfaſtneſs, prudence, wiſdome, and counſell: And in regard he is the firſt amongſt the Planets, therefore they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence one only independent, inſociate, firſt mover; and in reſpect of ♃ complexion, and ♎ the ſigne of Juſtice poſſeſſing the ninth Houſe from the Conjunction, it foreſhewed them to be a fruitfull people, an honeſt Linage, and all certain things, as Fortitude, Temperance, Patience, Wiſdome, Juſtice; and Propheſies, Temples, and Divine Ceremonies, righteous dealings and Laws.</p>
            <p>Other 3 Ages were alſo finiſhed in the daies of <hi>Ovid:</hi> And (as we have formerly noted) in the ☌ of ♃ and ♂ was the originall of the ſect of the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> So likewiſe the ☌ of ♃ and the ☉ begun the ſect of the Aegyptians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ♃ with ♀ that of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Ovid</hi> was of opinion; that two other Faiths (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> and the Moon,) were to ſucceed, and he flouriſhed in the 5184. year of the World, that was <hi>An.</hi> 15. before the Nativity of our Saviour, which Law of <hi>Mercury</hi> is hard to be believed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its ſo many ebbings and flowings, changes, and doubtings, which may be confirmed by any Arguments, and reaſons, ſpeeches and perſwaſions: And for that he was aſſiſted by ♀, therefore it

beautified the Temples with Tombs, Images, Muſicall Inſtruments, and Harmony: And becauſe ♀ hath ſignification of Women, and Orations, they therefore worſhip their bodies, and in regard of the Conceſſion of the Moon, which ſignifieth the people; ſhe denoted a People that ſhould do much good; But the ſignifications of ♀ and demonſtrated of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> 3. <hi>Apot.</hi> 12. 13. And becauſe that ☿ hath dominion over the Intellect, and wiſdom; and that his exaltation and houſe be in ♍, therefore hath God pointed out by theſe ſigns huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and annexed Divinity.</p>
            <p>But where ſhall theſe things happen, may ſome ſay? <hi>Albumazar, Lib,</hi> 6, of his <hi>Introduct.</hi> tells us, <hi>Quod regiones a virgine illuſtratae, ſunt Judea, Gallilea cum confinibus Euphratis, &amp; quaedam Perſia inſulae.</hi> That the Regions illuſtrated by the Virgin are <hi>Judea, Galilea</hi> with the Confines of Euphiates, and certain Iſlands of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Lunar Law declared by <hi>Ovid,</hi> which was the laſt, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavonr to corrupt and take away all Laws, and ſhall ſtrive to uſurp unto it ſelf divine worſhip, becauſe the Orb of the Moon is the loweſt, and her motion the moſt ſwift, therefore it cannot continue long, by the teſtimony of <hi>Ovid,</hi> by reaſon of its agreeableneſs with the Moon, which quickly and frequently changeth both in her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and light.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing (as we have ſaid) that in this Mock-ſtar the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail much, perhaps ſhe may ſignifie that falſe Prophet, for ſhe is La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the place of the Tropique, which is of wonderfull vertue and influence, in certain conſtellations and Conjunctions which have there happened. The Incubi do take the ſperm of men, and emitt it into Hyſtera, a woman, or Virgin, and thereby wonderfull men are generated, (ſuch as they ſay <hi>Merline</hi> was) and he ſhall be a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. So long alſo as the heart of the North ſhall Horoſcopate the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> Lady thereof, and ♄; they ſhall prepare wiſe men, working won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The Mock-ſtar alſo which appeared <hi>Anno</hi> 1604, ſo likewiſe the Conjunction <hi>Anno</hi> 1603, were ſcituated in the Eaſt, ſignifying a great man to be born: Therefore (2 <hi>Aph.</hi> 204.) It is ſaid, <hi>Quod Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And foraſmuch, as it happened in the Conſtellation of <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> and was afterwards reduced into the 7. degree of <hi>Taurus,</hi> therefore his ariſing may be eaſily conjectared to paſs, under the earthly Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: Or if we will deduce it from the great Conjunction, his ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114141:14"/>
ſhall be in the watery Triplicity: And for that the ſign <hi>Scorpio</hi> is the 9. from the place of the Conjunction, it is probable to be in <hi>Aſſyria</hi> or <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And being in the firſt decade of <hi>Taurus,</hi> he ſhall be (according to the learning of the Aegyptians) rather of a ſhort, then long ſtature, great-eyed, thick-bearded, thick-necked, whereon alſo ſhall be a mark, and another upon his head; a broad fore-head, ſharp-noſed, of a black curled hair, and ſmall Members; an eater of an unſatiable appetite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> walking ſtrongly: And by reaſon that <hi>Scorpio</hi> falls out in the 9 Houſe from the Conjunction (whereof <hi>Mars</hi> is Almuten) he ſhall acquire Kingdoms by Rapine, Fortitude, and cruelty: for it ſhould have been by Lature and frand, if it had been <hi>Saturn</hi> (by the 5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 16.) He ſhall alſo be terrible to devils, neither ſhall he fear want; nor ſhall baniſhment, or impriſonment affright him, neither ſhall he dread any grief, or regard to undergo the pains of death; he ſhall, not only by the power and vertue of words, but even by his own appearance, drive away evil ſpirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Magicall deluſions alſo, eitherby ſpels, or the Appellations of certain ſpirits, and by invocations, he ſhall attempt wonderfull things. He ſhall be indued with a moſt excellent wit, and a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of future events. He ſhall be brim-full of Hypocriſie, and lies, and ſhall have a cauterized Conſcience, and ſhall be the cauſe of much bloodſhed: He ſhall know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt true Doctrine, and Hereſie; and (if we conſider the place of the Mock-ſtar,) he ſhall ſeem to incline to the Faith of the Turks, and Hebrews.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, The Indians ſay: That in whatſoever place of the Zodiaque a Cornet firſt appears, from that place ſhall ariſe a ſtrong man, having a ſword in his left hand, but in his right hand a ſtaff, and upon his ſhoulders, 2. Candles: And in the ſame manner, a ſhip ſhall aſcend, upon which ſhall be a Lion; and upon the ſhip a naked man ſitting, and under the ſhip is the one half of the body of a dead woman.</p>
            <p>What is meant by the Sword, Staff, the Candles upon the mans ſhoulders? What the Lyon upon the Ship, the naked man, or the dead woman, let the lovers of truth enquire: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if you collocate the ſtar in the 1. and ♑ (the houſe of ♄ and exaltation of ♂) in the ninth Houſe the dominion of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolents ſhall be manifeſted.</p>
            <p>But the other Mock-ſtar of the year 1604<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which appeared (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it's viſible quantity) leſs then ♀, changed its colour every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114141:15"/>
moment, like to a Multiangled Diamond, with which if you turn the unbeams upon the eyes of the beholders, it will reflect with a variable luſtre: For from a bright yellow, anon it became Croceal, again in a moment like unto purple and reddiſh; for the moſt part, it appeared white, and of an amiable, and undiſturbed light, and as formerly we have declared; ſo that notwithſtanding it may por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend turbulencies, and ſeditions, yet in the end it may portend the Kingdom of peace; and the rather by reaſon of the colour, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the colour of ☿, who was Lord of the great Conjunction, which preceded the coming of our Saviour: Wherefore, there muſt needs be ſome profound myſtery in thoſe 2. Mock ſtars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the diſtance of time betwixt the appearance of the one and the other; in regard the ſpace of 33. years did intervene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, meaſuring the years of our Saviour: Therefore like as by the firſt we propheſied of the deſtruction of Monarchy, erected under the watery Triplicity, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Turks, becauſe in <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> which is oppoſite to <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and the ariſing of a falſe Prophet, and of the laſt Law which is to come: even ſo alſo may we propheſie of his coming (by the ſecond,) who diſpoſeth all things without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes: And ſeeing that this ſtar likewiſe remained firm, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates effects, alſo long-continuing, and powerfull: The wiſe Indians ſay, <hi>Circa illam partem in qua Pſeudoſtellarefulxit, aſcendere virum aurum viſu repreſentantem:</hi> That about the ſame part of the Heavens in which a Mock-ſtar firſt appeareth ſhall a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From all which, we may gather the great changes of Laws, and cuſtoms: For ſeeing that the firſt mock-ſtar, was obſerved to be in the Conſtellation of <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> it foretold, Impriſonments, Baniſhments, Tribulations, heavineſs, and grief of heart, Anxieties, Oppreſſions, and loſſes amongſt the people; and being in a fixed ſign (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> it threatned ſterile and dear years, by the 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 34. And a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and durability of thoſe effects, by the 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 54. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by its continuance: For, every Comet or other ſtar was wont to laſt (at the moſt) but the ſpace of ſix moneths (by 2. <hi>Apot.</hi>) except that Comet, which in the time of <hi>Joſephus</hi> (as himſelf reporteth <hi>Bell.

               </gap>uction: But this miraculous ſtar laſted more then a whole year; ſo that it is not to be doubted, but that its effects will extend themſelves to many future years: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was immovable, and in the 12. a fixed ſign, it doth not only
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114141:15"/>
premonſtrate a continuance of misfortunes, according to <hi>Meſſahala cap.</hi> 10. But likewiſe Seditions amongſt men, (by the 3. <hi>Aph.</hi> 117.) and very much effuſion of blood: And this we will prove in the firſt place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe (as before we noted) from a white, it changed to a ruddy <hi>Mars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="2">2. Becauſe, untill it had appeared above an entire year and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moneths, ♄ and ♃ in all that time moved through the houſes of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For that in every great Conjunction in the watery Triplicity as wel the future, as thoſe that are paſt, miſchief is ſtill done unto it by the infortunate aſpect of <hi>Mars:</hi> Wherefore it will be eaſie to pronounce the extermination of the Sect of the Turks, not only from the change of the Triplicity, but alſo by the ſtars being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſign of the great Conjunction: And that the ſtar (as but now we noted) was alwaies hurt by <hi>Mars,</hi> is evident; for, in the year 1583. whileſt that great Conjunction happened in the 3. face of ♓ <hi>Mars</hi> beheld the ſtar with a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>; for the ſtar (as hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſaid) was in the 3. and ♂ in the fifth. So in the year 1563. <hi>Aug</hi> 24. when there was the ſame great Conjunction in the laſt degr. of ♋, <hi>Mars</hi> was then poſited in the place of the mock-ſtar. And in the year 1544. <hi>Sept.</hi> 25. when the like great Conjunction alſo fell out in the laſt degree of ♍, although then <hi>Mars</hi> did not behold the Mock-ſtar, yet he beheld the great ☌ with a ⚹ Aſpect, which is accounted for a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1624. <hi>Febr.</hi> 1. there was the ſame great ☌ in the end of the firſt decade of ♓, with the preſence of <hi>Mars</hi> in ⚹ to the Mock-ſtar.</p>
            <p>And in the year 1504. <hi>June</hi> 10. was another in the ſecond face of ♋, and then the Sun was in ☌ with ☿, <hi>Venus</hi> in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to ♂; And <hi>Mars</hi> (for certain) beheld the place of the Mock-ſtar, that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1572. with a Platique ſquare.</p>
            <p>By all which it appeareth: That <hi>Mars</hi> did alwaies afflict this mock-ſtar with publique, and manifeſt enmity, as well before, as after its appearance, ſo likewiſe from hence, and from the change of the Triplicity, by the great Conjunctions from the watery into the fiery, from the mock-ſtar in oppoſition to the ſign Scorpio, we pronounce the extermination of the Sect of the Turks, and of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the turbulent, and violent birth and death of a falſe Prophet.</p>

            <p>Now if theſe things (by the authority of <hi>Albumazar</hi> and <hi>Haly,</hi>) be ſignified by a Simple Comet; How much more (then) by this mock ſtar, which was obſerved to be far greater, and of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance?</p>
            <p>And in the year 1603. in the end thereof, was a great Conjunction of ♄ and ♃ (as formerly we noted) revolved to the fiery Triplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the firſt face of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> not far from the Scorpions heart, of the firſt magnitude, of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> with the preſence of ☿ in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And (as we inſtanced before) If ſo great effects are ſignified by Comets, which laſt but the ſpace of three or four moneths; what ſhall this Mock ſtar portend, which laſted above a whole year?

            <p>We muſt now come to the particular times, when theſe things ſhall happen, and in what places; for, in this year, 1625. there beginneth a preparation for War, between the Princes in, and without <hi>Italy.</hi> The Plague likewiſe rageth in ſundry parts of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and a dearth of Corn. The effects proceed not only (as ſome ſuppoſe) from the annuall Revolution; for the annuall Revolution begins (according to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) when the Sun enters into the firſt point of ♈, and as well the preparation for wars, as thoſe Peſtilent diſeaſes, had their birth in former years: wherefore, ſuch wonderfull effects cannot be produced from the ſimple annuall Revolution, without the Eclipſes of the Luminaries, and ſome other notable Conſtallations, as the

moſt learned <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath inſinuated 4. <hi>Apot.</hi> 2. Therefore we may the rather conclude: that theſe things have ariſen from former cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for as it hath often been urged, <hi>Corpora Coelestia non agere in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanti, ſed cum tempore;</hi> The Caeleſtiall Bodies do not operate upon a ſuddain, but with ſome delay: And, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> atteſteth, <hi>Natura <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Abſis of <hi>Saturn</hi> is changed from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittary,</hi> the houſe of ♃, to <hi>Capricorn</hi> his proper houſe: And it is not to be doubted, but that the firſt point of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> is a place very powerfull, becauſe it is the ſolſtitial point, yet the terms belong to <hi>Mercury,</hi> who augment drought and moiſture, the Peſtilence, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of fruits, and animals, for ♄ hath ſignification of cold and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Mercury</hi> portendeth dryneſs, coagulation, and deadly windes (by 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 69.) and variety of the ſeaſon: Beſides, inundations, Earthquakes, Froſts, and ſnow, and extream cold, by 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 67. and when he is near unto the third ſtars of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> of the third mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, nigh to the <hi>Shaft,</hi> or in the ſhaft it ſelf, he hath greateſt force, ſo that then Traitors, and Man-ſlayers are produced.</p>

            <p>Beſides what hath been ſaid, this change alſo of the Abſides of ♄, do confirm what formerly we have delivered touching the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet by the 3 <hi>Aph.</hi> 136. In the tranſmutation of the <hi>Angis,</hi> and of the Regall and great Conjunctions, great men are born, although the Genitures do not ſhew it ſo expreſly.</p>
            <p>By the change of the Abſides of ♄ in ♋ <hi>Mahomet</hi> had his growth; Therefore by the ſame mutation of the Abſis in ♑ the oppoſite ſign, he ſhall ſuffer detriment, decay, and come to nothing: And this may be proved by the predictions of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the lying Prophet, in things belonging to the Kingdom of glory; (but perhaps he may have ſpoken the truth, in many things touching the ſucceſs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, of ſuch who ſhould follow his Law, and eſpecially when he foretold the time, wherein the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Laws was about to be deſtroyed) It is reported by many, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had the ſpirit of Divination; of others, that he was Lunatique, or oppreſſed with an evil ſpirit whereby he foretelling ſomething, which was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Devil, by little, and little, he grew into great eſteem amongſt the ignorant people, inſomuch that from a driver of Camels, he became the husband of an exceeding rich Heir; whereupon the ſpirit within him grew very haughty; and he begun to propheſie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and (by the help of <hi>Serguis Neſtorianus</hi> the Heretique, he was made Legiſlator, and wrote the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> The which (God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it) he knew ſhould have a great increaſe for 1000 years, but thoſe being finiſhed, the Mahumetans that ſucceeded, grew ſo faint, for the death of their King, that the Law by him eſtabliſhed was no longer obſerved. Wherefore the period of the 1000. years of the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall be thus manifeſted.</p>
            <p>The years of <hi>Mahomet</hi> of <hi>Hagira</hi> begun, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took his expedition for the defence of Religion, which was in the year of Chriſt 603. and he died in the year following, when he had 40. years: ſo that by accounting <hi>Hagira</hi> from this year; about the year 1630 when there ſhall happen ſo many Revolutions of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and when the <hi>Aux</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> paſſes into ♑ the ſign oppoſite

to <hi>Cancer</hi> (in which was the increaſe of his Law) ſhall be the end and deſtruction thereof; but by the word <hi>end,</hi> we underſtand not a totall extirpation, but a ſenſible beginning of its deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Again (to ſpeak Aſtrologically) ſeeing that the Faith of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> remaineth Martiall and Lunar, if we will take the leſſer years of theſe Planets, they will make up the 40.

And if to thoſe years we adde alſo the Fridary years of theſe Planets, his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and laſt deſtruction ſhall be about the year 1663. after great and horrible ſlaughters, and ealamities, and after the death of the falſe Prophet.</p>
            <p>The great Revolutions of the world and the infortunate effects of the by paſt Profections of the great Conjunctions preceding the Flood, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> are nowconfirmed: For, the profecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great Conjunction, which preceded the Flood, cometh, in the year 1632. to the ſign of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> which is the ſign of the Turks, and of <hi>Mahomet</hi> (as before we mentioned) and it is confirmed 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 68. by <hi>Albumazar, Tract</hi> 4. <hi>Differ.</hi> 8.

And then perchance (as we have often ſaid) ſhall a falſe Prophet ariſe, or a Great man; for betwixt the Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar (a 100. times repeated) <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. and that other in 1604. The mean years do number the age of our Saviour, and if we will add the ſame years to the year 1604. they will fall out in the year 1632. wherein the great Conjunction of the year 1583. (which happened in the watery Triplicity, and in the end of that Triangle,) ſhall come to the Mock ſtar, which ſhewed it ſelf <hi>An.</hi> 1572. And if (again) we add the ſame years, they ſhall happen about the years 1666. near which time the falſe miracles of the world ſhall be diſcovered, with the change, and deſtruction of (almoſt) all Sects: for in 1662. (it will take 48. degr. half, or 1666. if the whole degr.) the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in ♐ 1603. will come to the body of the Star, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. with the reſt, according to the operations of the Planets.</p>
            <p>In the year 1638. the eclipſe of the Sun, which happened in the year 1621. in the 0. degr. ♊, will come to the oppoſition of the Mock-ſtar, <hi>An.</hi> 1604.

(becauſe in the year 1653. the greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Zodiaque is accounted 23. degr. 28. min. which is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then it may be found to be by obſervation) for about thoſe times (as we have declared <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. of <hi>Great Con.</hi>) a leſſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the malevolents happeneth, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1650. in the

            <p>Moreover 1659. is the period of the revolution of the 14 Orbe, in which the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> and ♌ ſhall have dominion: and the revolution of the 15.

of his little Villages ſhall be overthrown. Seven kings ſhall be deſtroyed, and one ſhall be hallowed. The mothers bellies ſhall be ript open, and the children ſhall be abortive. There ſhall be a wonderfull great puniſhment of men, that the Natives may be reſtored. He that ſhall do theſe things ſhall become a Brazen-man; and he ſhall (for a long time after) keep the Gates of <hi>London,</hi> upon a Brazen-horſe. From thenceforth the red Dragon ſhall return to his peculiar temperature, and ſhall indeavour to exerciſe cruelty upon himſelf: Therefore ſhall the wrath of the moſt high come ſuddenly upon him; for the fields ſhall fruſtrate the labour of the hasbandman. A ſudden mortality ſhall ſnatch away the people, and ſhall ſweep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whole Nations.

A bleſſed King ſhall prepare a ſhip, and in a Princes Court, he ſhall be numbred among the 12. bleſſed.</p>
            <p>There ſhall be a lamentable deſolation of the Kingdom, and the Barn-floores full of Corn ſhall be turned into unprofitable woods. The white Dragon ſhall ariſe the ſecond time, and ſhall invite the daughter of Germany. Our little villages ſhall once more be repleniſhed with a ſtrange generation, and the red Dragon ſhall languiſh in the end of the Lake. Afterward ſhall the German Worm be crowned, and the Brazen Prince ſhall be humbled. A bound is ſet him, which he cannot paſs: For, he ſhall remain 150. years in disquiet, but he ſhall be in ſubjection 300. years. Then ſhall the North wind riſe againſt him, and ſhall ſnatch away the Flowers, which the weſt wind begot. Churches ſhall be beautified, yet ſhall not the ſword depart. The German Worm ſhall hardly keep his den, becauſe vengeance ſhall ſuddenly come upon him for his treacherie: at length, he ſhall flouriſh for a while, but the Decimation of the Normans ſhall offend him: for the people ſhall ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They ſhall undergo the yoke of perpetuall ſervitude; and they ſhall wound their mother with mattocks, and ploughs. Two Dragons ſhall ſucceed, whereof one ſhall be choaked by the dart of envy, but the other ſhall return under the ſhadow of a Kingly name.

The greedy hounds ſhall be ham-ſtring'd, the Beaſts of the Forreſt ſhall reſt in quiet, humanity ſhall bewail the puniſhment: the coyn ſhall be cleft, and each half ſhall be made round.

            <p>The ſixt ſhall overthrow the wals of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſhall turn the forreſts thereof into plain fields.

            <p>From <hi>Conanus</hi> ſhall come a warlike Boar, who ſhall exerciſe the ſharpneſs of his teeth, within the French Forreſts: for he ſhall hew down all the greater Oaks, but he ſhall give protection to the leſſer. <hi>The Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Affricans</hi> ſhall quake for fear of him, for the violence of his motion ſhall threaten the further <hi>Spain.</hi> A Goat of the Venerean houſe ſhall ſucceed him, having golden horns, and a ſilver beard, who ſhall breath forth ſuch a cloud from his Noſtrils as that the ſurface of the whole Iſle ſhal be obſcured.

The other two ſhall ſupply the room thereof, untill (by the multitude of their leaves) one ſhall cover another. But afterward it ſhall obtain the room of two, and ſhall ſuſtain Birds of Forraign Nations.

of his Embaſſages to the world with all men, find a mutuall reception by the trygonall rayes of true affection: but that ſom carping Zoilus by the Cynicall inventions of his combuſt wits would with Envies Saturnine ſquare, indeavour to afflict them: but that truth's more near conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like Phoebus in his exaltation, hath wrought an utter prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe malevolent beams, from working any impreſſion upon wiſe mens underſtandings.</p>
            <p>Such (that I may ſtoop to vulgar capacities) is the condition of this Malignant age, that we ſure are fallen into the very dreggs of the times; when there is not only an endeavour that truth may be trampled down, but alſo Arts muſt be defamed; Artiſts ſcandalized, and men for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth muſt be detracted:</p>
            <p>As may appear by the ſcandalous exclamations of that Arts defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>George Naworth</hi> or <hi>VVharton,</hi> in his late Satyricall Libels put forth againſt thoſe famous Ptolomies of this Nation <hi>Mr. Lilly</hi> and <hi>Mr. Booker:</hi> and all out of meer malice and madneſs, that they have by their hitherto-unparralleld skill, ſo wonderfully proved themſelves more able and more approved Artists then he; that they for the truth of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions have born away the credit of the Art, when he for his fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deluſions muſt become the Ludibrium of the Kingdome, and ſcorn of the Learned on either ſide.</p>
            <p>But is he this very Aſinego, ſo ſimple as to imagine, that he ſhall now recover by his malice, the credit he long ſince loſt by his ignorance. It doth but render him in the eye of the world, the more ridiculous, to ſee him put to ſo poor ſhifts, as to act a ſcolds part to help himſelf; when he hath had the worſe by fighting, to get a good way of and chide, as if that would recruit his loſt credit; whereof he was never much guilty.</p>
            <p>What fault of <hi>Mr. Lilly</hi> or <hi>Mr. Booker</hi> was it, that his predictions failed? That he muſt needs inveigh againſt them with his ſcurrilous language, <hi>Aeſops dog ſuffers not the Oxe to eate Hay.</hi> So <hi>Noworth</hi> juſt like a bleezing traveller, that by his buzardly clumſineſs tumbles in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a quick-ſand, and there ſticking, raileth and rageth againſt thoſe that hit the right way by the ſame, better then he, calling them all to peices, becauſe they were not as very buzzards as himſelf to plunge into the ſame puddle for company.</p>
            <p>Thus becauſe Corporall <hi>VVharton</hi> hath overwhelmed himſelf in ſuch groſs errours in Judgement, therefore <hi>Mr. Lilley</hi> is a whelp, and <hi>Mr. Booker</hi> a barking mungrill, (as he is pleaſed to term them) this is wiſe Logick.</p>
            <p>But let any Judge, whether ſuch titles do not more properly belong

            </p>
            <p>Who doth not behold how he having ſtrayned himſelf out of breath and out of credit, to purchaſe fame from that famous Art, and having through his unskilfulneſs (the matter being above the ſphear of his capacity) quite miſt of that honour he ſo eagerly purſued; is faine for ſpight that <hi>Mr. Lilly</hi> and <hi>Mr. Booker</hi> have born away from him the trophies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, to fall upon triviall and frivolous matters; as to tax them with miſtakes in Arithmeticks, which were they true as he alleadgeth, were matters ſo inconſiderable, and of ſo ſmall concernment, that they cannot in point of Judgement produce any ſenſible errour, and therefore can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſcate the effulgencie of their fame no more, then an Attome can ecpliſe the Sun.</p>
            <p>What praiſe or applauſe can he purchaſe, for preſuming ſo much upon his computations, being but the very Theorick principles of the Art, wherein very Tyro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s are not ignorant, much leſs experienced Artiſts? When in the <hi>Judiciary Praxis,</hi> wherein all the credit of the Art conſiſteth, he hath ſo utterly ſhamed himſelf. Let him ſhew me one true prediction of his, ſince he firſt wrote.</p>
            <p>Shall not that Scrivener be rather exploded by all, then applauded by any, that vaunteth how he hath ruled his lines right, when all men ſee he hath written ne'r a true letter. Sure <hi>George VVharton</hi> is very ſimple to think there is any that will heed his vain boaſts, unleſs is be to hiſs at his folly, for advancing his own accurat ſcrupuloſſity, and vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Lillyes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bookers</hi> labours; when the whole Kingdome to his perpetuall ſhame teſtifies againſt him, how wonderfully the ſucceſſes of the Engliſh affaires have anſwered their predictions to their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renowne; when his great vapours proved but mountains of ſmoak that are vaniſht, and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>Sure, braſs-fac'd <hi>VVharton</hi> hath learned Vulcans craft from that great thief <hi>Cacus;</hi> who being driven into a ſtraight by <hi>Hercules,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to diſgorge out of his ſulphurious ſtomach, great cloudes of ſmoak and fire, only to dazle the eyes of the beſiegers, for the better accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his evaſion. But although Snarling <hi>VVhartons</hi> late ſmoakie vapours belched forth from the ranckour of a Malignant heart, have been only intended to delude the World, and to eclipſe the ſplendor of the Art and Artiſts, only for his Errours eſcape of their deſerved cenſures:

Yet have we thoſe experienced Atlantes, that would ſoon diſcover the deceipt, but that it is needleſs, in regard his own erroneous pen hath to all men been the ſufficient Index of his folly.</p>
            <p>What credit gets an Archer to boaſt that he took his aime directly at the white, when indeed he hath miſt the Butt?

Thus Cobler-<hi>Wharton</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fairely his great Cannons of commination, and Thunderclaps of threats againſt the Parliament, and City of <hi>London,</hi> and againſt their forces, when they hit <hi>Oxford, York, Newcaſtle, Salop, &amp;c.</hi> ſhot down their own garriſons, diſperſt their Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For who is ſo ſimple as to conceive that they<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Lillyes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Merline.</note> whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht judgements have effected the Arts ſo great advancement, ſhould be ignorant in the principles thereof, or be now to learne either by common Arithmeticall, Logorithmeticall, or Sinicall computations, how to performe their calculations?</p>
            <p>So that had there been in their ſchemes ſuch ſlender defects, as he ſuggeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eth, this were all the conſtruction could be made thereof: that thereby it appeareth how Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Booker</hi> have for their fame been taken up with ſo great acquaintance, and their companies ſo by Nobles and Gentlemen frequented, that it were no marvell, therefore no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they having ſo little time to perfect their accompts, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome overſights therein, ſeeing they are forced ſo haſtily, and with their ſtudies ſo often interruption, to performe the fame: ſo that it could not be imputed to any ignorance in them, but only haſty overſights, if they had committed ſuch ſmall miſtakes: when on the contrary, it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hereby appears how this poor Renegado <hi>VVharton</hi> who for being too monarchicall, is now become monachall, is ſo far from having his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies interrupted, that he is for his erroneous and deluſive writings by all deſerted and derided; and therefore hath leaſure ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114141:34"/>
and reviſe his accounts; who had he for any great esteem, or requeſt he had been in, had ſuch continuall conflux to him, as Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booker</hi> have, of ingenious and noble Spirits, he had had as little leaſure to inſiſt upon ſuch toys in Art as they have: the truth whereof may the more manifeſtly appear, in that while he was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and while ſome ſmall glimpſe of hopes, which his friends had of his skill, did ſomewhat ſupport his credit, he could not at all anſwer their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by inſiſting on ſuch ſcruples, till now that he is caſhiered and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from all ſociety, and now he may take time enough to pick ſtraws againſt thoſe judicious Artiſts: ſo that to tax them with ſuch trifles doth but add to their honour, and his own diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Yet will no man blame Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> for ſuſpecting his inſufficiency in Art, when he corrected him of thoſe errours by him committed in his calculations, in regard the ſame (although they could not disparage one, whoſe predictions, reall verifications have ſufficiently declared him an able Artiſt) yet might well aggravate the ſuſpition of ignorance of the very principles of Art, in one whoſe unskilfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſo far from being in any particular anſwered by, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved altogether contrary to all events ſucceeding.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems plundering <hi>Wharton</hi> by his own confeſſion being ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the counterfeit name of <hi>Naworth,</hi> had like to have cheated the world with his forgeries undiſcovered. I cannot blame him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed to be angry at Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> for pulling off that vizard, and making him ſo unluckily known to his Countrey, ſeeing thereby he is like not onely to become a ludibrious contempt to all that know him, but alſo to remain upon record to all poſterity, not <hi>VVharton</hi> anagramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, but <hi>VVharton</hi> ſtigmatiz'd with the brand of <hi>Englands</hi> lying Prophet, and Aſtrologies defamer to his perpetuall ſhame, and infamy.</p>
            <p>So that, ſeeing he had proved himſelf that Philoſopher (<hi>Qui dum contemplatur coelum, incidit in puteum</hi>) by confounding himſelf in ſuch groſs errors of judgement: he was worſe then mad to go now again to ſtir up a new thoſe puddles of diſgrace, from whence nothing but a greater ſtinck of reproach, and obloquie will flie into his face.</p>
            <p>And for the Art, what credit or esteem had Aſtrology been in by this time in <hi>England,</hi> had there been no better judgements, than Ignoramus <hi>VVhartons</hi> to relie upon for its advancement? And yet will he be ſo ill a friend to the Art he pretends to, that can neither advance the fame thereof himſelf, nor is willing it ſhould retain that fame, it hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from profounder judgements: What credit I marvell in any one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114141:34"/>
particular hath either the Art by him, or he by the Art at any time received? yea, rather what diſcredit hath that rare and worthy Science ſuſteined by means of his unworthy, and unskilfull pen: inſomuch, as partly among weake, and partly among diſ-affected judgements Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy began to be vilified, and undervalued, and had by this time been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly exploded and rejected by all, and all through his ignorance, had not the truth of Mr. <hi>Lillies</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bookers</hi> predictions to their no leſs commendations then admiration of all, diſſipated thoſe vapours of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and maintained the Art in its resplendent luſtre.</p>
            <p>It is wondred therefore by all, which read his late books, ſeeing he hath deluded the world ſo by his former ignorance and folly, with what face he can ſo impudently intrude himſelf upon the theater of the world to act another feels part in a new ſcene of ignorance and malice to move the people to laughter: and that he had not rather for very ſhame of himſelf, ſequeſtred himſelf from humane ſociety, or mew'd himſelf up in ſome Dungeon of ſolitarineſs, and pin'd himſelf to death for very grief and anguiſh, that he had ſo unluckily by his ſycophantique fables betrayed his Soveraign, and the Royall tarty.</p>
            <p>Whether was more the Kings friend, and deſerved better of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seeing therefore this blinde Aſſe <hi>VVharton</hi> like an unskilfull Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian piped ſo long to this Kingdom, and could hit never a true note; it had been far more wiſdom now, even to have put up his pipes and been ſilent, than to ſqueak out a new his diſgraces to the world, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily by this time might have been forgotten.</p>
            <p>But any impartiall eye, that peruſes his late pamphlets, muſt needs read every word therein, but as ſo many characters of his malios, ſeeing in the laſt pages of his Almanack, he can confeſs the Prutenick, and Rudolphine Tables, &amp;c. very erroneous and defective, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to the credit of the Authors thereof, which indeed they in no kinde deſerved; but in Mr. <hi>Lillies,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bookers</hi> computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would needs fuſten errours of ignorance on them which are not ſo: Why had he not reputed <hi>Copernicus, Alphonſus, Lansberg,</hi> thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous computations, to whom all Aſtrologers are ſo much beholden?

Behold the Map of malice, and partialitie! but we may diſcover his malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rancour alſo, if we look but upon <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> himſelf, whom all men ſo highly, and indeed moſt deſervedly commend, ſeeing we ſhall finde him not regarding ſuch ſtrictneſs, or preciſeneſs in his Tables, which are the very platform of Aſtrologers calculations, as to compleat the ſame with ſuch exactneſs (although he perform as much as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite) but that we may finde ſome difference therein, in his ſeverall wayes of working his computations: for if we would gather the Oblique <hi>Aſc.</hi> of the 4. <hi>gr.
